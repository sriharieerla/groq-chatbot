2. Navigate to the project directory: cd groq-chatbot
3. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set up your GROQ API key securely:
   Create a .env file in the root directory: GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

Add .env to .gitignore to keep it private.

from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
load_dotenv()
api_key = os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY")

Run the chatbot: python chatbot.py
