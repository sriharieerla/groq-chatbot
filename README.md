# GROQ Voice-Enabled AI Assistant ðŸ¤–ðŸŽ¤

Excited to share an upgrade to my recent project!

Earlier, I built an AI Chatbot powered by **Groq AI**. Now, Iâ€™ve enhanced it into a **Voice-Enabled AI Assistant** that feels more interactive and human-like â€” perfect for practicing mock interviews or everyday AI interactions.

## âœ¨ Key Highlights

- **Voice Input:** Integrated **Speech-to-Text (STT)** to understand your voice queries.
- **Voice Output:** Added **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** for natural, human-like AI responses.
- **Powered by Groq API:** Lightning-fast inference for real-time interaction.
- **Interactive & Practical:** Now works as a personal voice assistant for learning, practice, and more.

This upgrade makes the chatbot smarter, faster, and more engaging. Always exploring ways to push the boundaries of AI projects and make them more impactful! ðŸŒŸ
